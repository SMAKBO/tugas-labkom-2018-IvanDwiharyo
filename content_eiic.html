       <p class="title is-5">the effects of formaldehydes</p>
      <p class="subtitle">Formalin is a toxic substance and very irritating to the skin and eyes. Formalin for the human body is known as toxic substances, carcinogenic (cancer-causing), mutagen (causing cell changes, body tissue), corrosive and irritating. Steam from formalin itself is very dangerous if inhaled by respiratory and irritating if swallowed by humans. For the eyes, how absorbed this formalin remains irritating. If swallowed then the person should be immediately watered as much as possible and immediately vomit the contents of his stomach.
Adverse health effects on a person exposed to formaldehyde may be acute or chronic exposure (years), including headache, chronic inflammation (rhinitis), nausea, respiratory distress in the form of a chronic cough or shortness of breath chronic. Formalin can also damage the persyarafan human body and is known as a substance that is toxic to our nervous system (neurotoxic). Disturbances in the nervousness of sleepiness, sensitive, easy to forget, and difficult to concentrate. In women will cause menstrual disorders and infertilas. Formalin can also be absorbed by the skin and as mentioned above can also be inhaled by our breathing. Therefore, direct contact with the substance without swallowing it can also be bad for health. Long-term use of formaldehyde in humans can cause cancers of the mouth and throat. Even in animal studies causing skin cancer and lung cancer.
The dangers of short and long term formalin exposure are:<ul><b>a.  When Inhaled </b></ul>

<ul><u>1.1 How to deal with and overcome the danger of formalin </u></ul> 
Issues of the presence of formalin contained in foodstuffs and daily cutlery is indeed to watch out for. But it should not overreact. Not that we should at all not eat tofu, meatballs, wet noodles or salted fish. Or we should not avoid plastic or melamine material for our cutlery. Because not all food or cutlery contains formalin. The important consumers should be observant with respect to the quality of food and eating utensils purchased or used. Prevention of direct exposure to formalin should be done, especially for industrial workers who use formalin materials. In order not to be inhaled use a respiratory protective device, such as masks, cloths and other tools that can prevent the possibility of entry of formalin into the nose or mouth. Complete an explosion proof explosion-proof ventilation system. Use eye protection or spectral resistance glasses. Provide a water faucet to wash the eyes of the workplace which is useful in case of an emergency accident. Prevention of exposure to the skin should wear protective gloves and protective clothing chemicals. Avoid eating, drinking and smoking during work or hand washing before eating. Although the impact is very dangerous if it accumulates in the body, it is not wise to forbid the use of formalin. Many industries require formalin so it must be wise in using it.
